# clustering_visualization
This repo provides highly modifiable notebooks which aim to provide visualization on how some clustering algorithms work.

You can set any dataset you want and see the behavior of the clustering algorithm on that dataset.

The algorithms are modified or taken from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

You can run the notebooks without any particular setup on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
